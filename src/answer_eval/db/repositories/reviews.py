"""Teacher review persistence + resolution (Milestone 13).

Every teacher decision is audited (#53): the original AI result is never
overwritten — corrections live in teacher_overrides, decisions in
teacher_reviews, and both are mirrored into audit_events. Final results point
at the approved version. WAITING_FOR_REVIEW is a valid state that resolves
back to completed (#85).
